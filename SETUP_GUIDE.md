### 5. Sample Email Template

```
Subject: Application for Software Developer Position

Message:

### 6. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

**"Not authenticated with Gmail" error:**
- Make sure you've completed the Google OAuth setup
- Check that your Client ID and Secret are correct in `.env`
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting Gmail

**CORS errors:**
- Ensure both servers are running (backend on 3000, frontend on 5174)
- Check that CORS is configured for the correct ports

**PDF extraction not working:**
- Ensure the PDF contains readable text (not scanned images)
- Try with a simple PDF containing clear email addresses

**Email sending fails:**
- Verify Gmail API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Check that you've granted the correct permissions
- Ensure your Google account has 2-factor authentication enabled

### 7. Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your Google OAuth credentials secure
- The application stores tokens in memory (for production, use a proper database)
- Only grant access to trusted users during testing phase

### 8. Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set up a proper database for token storage
2. Use environment variables for all sensitive data
3. Configure HTTPS and update OAuth redirect URIs
4. Implement proper error handling and logging
5. Add rate limiting for API endpoints
6. Publish your OAuth app (remove test mode)
